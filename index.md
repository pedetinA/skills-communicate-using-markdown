###### Lets start with the command to initialize git below:
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
###### Just like a javascript command; all anguages have their syntax
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
###### The following languages make use of readable english language, except the unticked one.
- [x] HTML
- [x] Markdown
- [ ] Python
